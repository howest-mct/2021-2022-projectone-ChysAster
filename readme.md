## Instructables

https://www.instructables.com/Smart-4-in-a-Row-Game/

## Structure

This project uses a front-end backend and database structure.
For the front-end we use HTML, CSS and javascript. For the backend we use python and for the database sql.

## Database

To get the database up and running you need to chance the database= in config.py to the name you gave your database.

## Backend

The only thing you have to chance in the backend is the pin numbering of your infrared sensors, the badge numbers(team yellow en blue) and the pins from the buzzers.
